Why Generics?
	When same class is required to work upon different objects then Generics comes in handy such that we don't have to create multiple classes with same content to handle different object types
	
Bound Type
	we can bound what type of Generics can be defined for the class
	NumberFns<T extends Number>
	
	now the class accepts only Number types i.e. Integer, Float, Double
	
WildCard
	NumberFns<?>
