equals (Deep Comparison), hashcode(), toString() 
=================================================

Car c1 = new Car("Maruti", 2018);
Car c2 = new Car("Maruti", 2018);
Car c3 = new Car("Renault", 2018);
Car c4 = new Car("Maruti", 2020);

c1 is equal to c2
but if the hashcode method is not implemented properly then when these objects are added in HashSet or HashMap these will result in duplicate object present in collection
