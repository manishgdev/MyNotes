### var, const & let

#### var
<ul>
<li>`var` declarations are function-scoped. They are visible throughout the function in which they are declared, even if declared inside blocks like if or for.</li>
<li>Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means you can use the variable before it's declared without getting a ReferenceError, although its value will be undefined.</li>
<li>`var` variables can be redeclared within the same scope without causing an error. </li>
<li>`var` variables can be reassigned new values.</li>
</ul>

```JavaScript
function example() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 10;
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 10
}
example();
```

#### let

<ul>
<li>`let` declarations are block-scoped. They are only visible within the block in which they are declared.</li>
<li>Variables declared with `let` are not hoisted to the top of their scope. Trying to access them before they are declared will result in a ReferenceError.</li>
<li>`let` variables cannot be redeclared within the same scope.</li>
<li>`let` variables can be reassigned new values.</li>
</ul>

```JavaScript
function example() {
  if (true) {
    let x = 10;
  }
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
}
example();

```

#### const
<ul>
<li>const declarations are block-scoped, similar to let.</li>
<li>Variables declared with const are not hoisted to the top of their scope.</li>
<li>const variables must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration and cannot be left uninitialized.</li>
<li>const variables cannot be reassigned a new value once they are initialized. However, for objects and arrays, the properties or elements within them can still be mutated.</li>
</ul>

```javascript
function example() {
  const x = 10;
  x = 20; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
}
example();

```

#### When to use each
<ul>
<li>Use `const` by default for variables that won't be reassigned.</li>
<li>Use `let` for variables that will be reassigned.</li>
<li>Avoid using `var` unless you specifically need its function-scoping behavior, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.</li>
</ul>

These are general guidelines, and the choice between `var`, `let`, and `const` depends on the specific requirements of your code and your preference for readability and maintainability.

### Arrow functions 
Arrow functions are a concise syntax introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) for defining functions in JavaScript. They provide a more compact and expressive way to write functions compared to traditional function expressions. Here's an overview of arrow functions:

```
// Single-line arrow function without curly braces
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// Single-line arrow function with curly braces
const multiply = (a, b) => { return a * b; };

// Multi-line arrow function with curly braces
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  console.log('Welcome to Arrow Functions!');
};
```
#### Features
<li>Concise Syntax: Arrow functions have a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions, making them more concise and easier to read.</li>

<li>Implicit Return: When the function body consists of a single expression, you can omit the return keyword, and the expression's value will be automatically returned.</li>

<li>Lexical this Binding: Arrow functions do not have their own this context. Instead, they inherit this from the enclosing lexical context. This behavior can be useful when working with callbacks or event handlers.</li>

#### arguments object

`arguments` object not bound with arrow function

```javascript
const add = function(a, b) {
    console.log(arguments);
    return a + b;
}
```

`add(4, 5)`; will print [4, 5] and then sum of [4, 5]
`add(4, 5, 6)`; will print [4, 5, 6] even though method is declared with two params and then sum of [4, 5]

```
// arrow function

const add = (x) => {
    console.log(arguments); // arguments is not defined, will give error
    return a + b;
}
```

#### `this` keyword not bound to arrow function
```javascript
const user = {
    name : "Manish",
    cities : ["Mumbai", "Bikaner", "Varanasi"],
    placesLived : function() {
        console.log(this.name);
        console.log(this.cities);
        const that = this;
        this.cities.forEach(function(city) {
            // console.log("this.name :- "+this.name + " has lived in ", city); // this is not accessible
            console.log("that.name :- "+that.name + " has lived in ", city);
        })
    },
    placesLivedArrow : function () {
        this.cities.forEach((city) => { // this refers to parent scope of function i.e. the user object
            console.log(this.name + " has lived in ", city);
        })
    },
    placesLivedArrow2 : () => { // this arrow function doesn't bind its own "this" value and goes up to the parent scope which is global scope (parent of user object) and is undefined
        this.cities.forEach((city) => { // this here will be undefined
            console.log(this.name + " has lived in ", city);
        }) 
    },
    placesLivedArrow3() { // to avoid implementation array of placesLivedArrow2
        this.cities.forEach((city) => { 
            console.log(this.name + " has lived in ", city);
        }) 
    }
}
```
<ul>
<li>for the above user object placesLived() is normal ES5 syntax, this is not accessible inside the cities iterator, so we have to create a "that" variable and copy "this" into "that" & then we can get the name property</li>
<li>placesLivedArrow -> with the use of Arrow function, the arrow function doesn't bind its own "this" value, rather it refers to parent scope of the function, in this case parent scope for "placesLivedArrow" is user object</li>
<li>placesLivedArrow3() -> ES6 definition similar to "placesLivedArrow" function</li>
</ul>

#### Differences from Traditional Functions
<ul>
<li> No arguments Object : Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object. Instead, they inherit arguments from the enclosing scope.</li>
<li>Cannot Be Used as Constructors: Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors with the new keyword. They do not have their own this context, so attempting to use new with an arrow function will result in a runtime error.</li>

</ul>

```javascript
// Traditional function expression
const traditionalFunction = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// Arrow function equivalent
const arrowFunction = (a, b) => a + b;

console.log(traditionalFunction(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(arrowFunction(2, 3));       // Output: 5

```

#### Use Cases
<ul>
<li>Arrow functions are commonly used for short, one-liner functions like array iteration methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) or callback functions.</li>
<li>They're particularly useful in functional programming and when working with Promises, as they provide a more concise syntax for handling asynchronous operations.</li>
</ul>

Arrow functions offer a more modern and concise way to define functions in JavaScript, improving code readability and maintainability. However, it's essential to understand their differences from traditional functions and their limitations when working with certain features of the language.

### Spread Operator
The spread operator (`...`) in JavaScript is a powerful tool that allows you to expand elements of an iterable (like arrays or strings) into individual elements. It's used in various contexts, including array literals, function arguments, and object literals. Here's a breakdown of how the spread operator works:

#### Array Literals
You can use the spread operator to create a new array by combining multiple arrays or adding new elements to an existing array.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];

const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```

#### Function Arguments
In function calls, you can use the spread operator to pass an array as individual arguments to a function.

```javascript
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const result = sum(...numbers);
console.log(result); // Output: 6
```

#### Object Literals
With objects, the spread operator allows you to create new objects by merging the properties of existing objects or adding new properties.

```javascript
const obj1 = { foo: 'bar' };
const obj2 = { baz: 'qux' };

const mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
console.log(mergedObject); // Output: { foo: 'bar', baz: 'qux' }

```

#### Cloning Arrays and Objects
You can use the spread operator to create shallow copies of arrays and objects.

```javascript
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const copyOfArray = [...originalArray];

const originalObject = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const copyOfObject = { ...originalObject };

```

#### Rest Parameters
In function declarations, the spread operator is also used as the rest parameter, which collects all remaining arguments into an array.

```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // Output: 15

```
The spread operator is a versatile feature in JavaScript that simplifies working with arrays, objects, and function arguments, making your code more concise and expressive.
