Open API
============
	Overview
	=========
		API
		***********
			- Application Programming Interface
			- a method for two computer application to speak to each other
			
			Types :-
				Clicking on link in Email
				Closed APIs - technology API
				Open APIs - adopts broadly accepted standards
				
			APIs allows the internet to function
			
			Two Primary types of WebServices
				1. SOAP    - older legacy systems
				2. RESTful - moden adoption, widely used
					REST - REpresentation State Transfer
						Representation - Typically JSON or XML
						State transfer - Typically via HTTP
						
						- Verbs :- HTTP Methods : GET, PUT (Create/Update), POST(Create), DELETE, HEAD (like GET, but only asks for meta information without the body), TRACE (echo the recieved request), OPTIONS (returns HTTP methods supported by the server for the specified URL), CONNECT (Converts request to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, typically for HTTPS through an unencrypted HTTP proxy), PATCH (Partial modifications to the specified resource)
						- Messages:- payload of the action (JSON/XML)
						- URI :- Uniform Resource Identifier
						- URL :- Uniform Resource Location (URI with network information)
						
						- SAFE Methods :- Only fetch information and don't cause changes on the server	
							GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE
						
						- IDEMPOTENT Methods :-
							Idempotence :- A quality of an action such that repititions of the action have no further effect on the outcome
							
							PUT & DELETE are idempotent
						
							Safe methods are also idempotent
						
						- NON-IDEMPOTENT Methods :-
							Multiples requests of POST are likely to create multiple resources
							
							POST
						
			HTTP Protocol
				Standards developed by
					1. IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force
					2. W3C  - World Wide Web Consortium
					
					HTTP/1.1 still in used
					
				HTTP/2.0 - developed in 2015
					- high level of compatibility with HTTP/1.1
					- Improves page load speed by
						- lower latency
						- higher throughput
						
			HTTP Status Codes for series
				10x - informational in nature
				20x - indicates successful requests - 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 Accepted
				30x - redirections - 301 Moved Permanently
				40x - client errors - 400 Bad Request, 401 Not Authorized, 404 Not Found
				50x - server side errors - 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable
			
	OpenAPI - OpenAPI Specification
	===================================
		OA3 - Open API 3.x
		widely adopted standard for describing APIs
		
		specifications are defined in YAML or JSON
		
		OpenAPI specification is backed by formal schema
		
	OpenAPI 2.0 vs 3.0
	========================
		OpenAPI 1.0 - Swagger
		OpenAPI 2.0 - Smart Bear acquired Swagger and came up with Open API 2.0
		OpenAPI 3.0 - componets were made more reusable
		
	YAML
	=============
		https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/
		https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml
		
		https://editor.swagger.io/ - view the live view of yaml file

	JSON Schema
	=============
		https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/

	Open API DataTypes
	=================
		https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.2.md#data-types
		
	allOf, anyOf, oneOf, no
	==========================
		https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/oneof-anyof-allof-not/
		
	Parameter Types
	=================
		https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.2.md#parameterObject
			Path Parameters
			Query Parameters
			header
			cookie
		
	Group API end-points by using tags property in path object
		same end-point can be grouped into multiple groups
		tags: 
          - Beers
		  
	Common Resoinse Codes
		200 - OK
		201 - Resource Created
		400 - Bad Request
		404 - Not found
		409 - Conflict
		
	Swagger Callbacks
		https://swagger.io/docs/specification/callbacks/
		look for more tutorials for getting further details on it
		
	Swagger Authentication and Authorizations
	==========================================
		https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/
		
		to remove security for any end-point
			define empty array for security attribute in the operation (GET /POST etc)
			security: []
